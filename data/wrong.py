Using this make the csv for the LLAMA model fine tuning for making the Question generation engine for LeetPandas which is the Leetcode like platform for Data Science interview preparation platform: List accessor#
Arrow list-dtype specific methods and attributes are provided under the
Series.list accessor.


Series.list.flatten()
Flatten list values.

Series.list.len()
Return the length of each list in the Series.

Series.list.__getitem__(key)

To fine-tune the LLAMA model for creating a question generation engine focused on the LeetPandas platform (a Leetcode-like platform for Data Science interview preparation), we need to build a structured CSV dataset containing relevant information about list accessor methods and attributes in pandas. The dataset should focus on the "Series.list" accessor methods that are mentioned, like flatten(), len(), and __getitem__, to help the model generate questions related to these methods.

Here’s a structure for how the CSV can look, with columns that include:

    Method Name: The name of the method (e.g., flatten(), len(), __getitem__()).
    Description: A description of what the method does.
    Example Input: An example input data (Series with list values).
    Expected Output: The expected output from the method applied to the example input.
    Question: A question related to the method that could be useful for LeetPandas' interview preparation.
